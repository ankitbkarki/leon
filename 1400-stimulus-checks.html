                    As the U.S. continues to recover from the economic effects of the pandemic, the government has issued various rounds of stimulus checks to support citizens.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Is the $1400 Stimulus Check?</h2>
                <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    The $1400 stimulus check was part of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021, aimed at helping individuals and families financially recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal was to provide quick, direct financial support to those affected by job loss, reduced income, and other financial hardships.
                </p>
                <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    Since its introduction, the $1400 check has been distributed in multiple phases, with payments continuing into 2025 as part of ongoing recovery efforts.

                <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    Although the stimulus checks were initially launched in 2021, the economic challenges faced by millions of Americans in the aftermath of the pandemic are still being felt in 2025. As a result, the government has continued providing these stimulus payments to help stabilize finances and encourage economic activity.
