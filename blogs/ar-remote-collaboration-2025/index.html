It’s not just a “pandemic thing” anymore—it’s the new normal, or, well, close enough. But here’s the strange part: while video calls and Slack messages are fine (mostly), they’re not exactly built for deep collaboration. You know, the kind where you’re sketching something out on a whiteboard, pointing at a prototype, or walking through a design in real space.</p><p data-start="699" data-end="936">This is where augmented reality (AR) is starting to change the game. And in 2025, it’s no longer just some niche tech for gamers or tech conferences—it’s becoming a surprisingly practical tool for remote teams in all kinds of industries.</p><p data-start="938" data-end="1223">We’re not saying every remote worker is walking around in AR glasses (yet), but a growing number of professionals—engineers, designers, field service technicians, even marketers—are now using AR to bridge that "presence gap" and make remote collaboration feel more like the real thing.</p><p data-start="1225" data-end="1259">Let’s unpack how that’s happening.</p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq8hca431fo">1.

The Basics: What Does “AR for Remote Collaboration” Actually Mean?</h2><p data-start="1340" data-end="1569">Before diving into use cases, let’s clarify the term. AR (Augmented Reality) overlays digital information—objects, labels, instructions, whatever—on top of your view of the real world, usually through a phone, tablet, or headset.</p><p data-start="1571" data-end="1773">In the context of remote collaboration, AR allows two or more people in different locations to interact with the same digital content in real time, while still being aware of their physical environment.</p><p data-start="1775" data-end="1884">So instead of just screen sharing or sending screenshots, you’re both <em data-start="1845" data-end="1853">inside</em> the shared work. You might be:</p><ul data-start="1886" data-end="2098"><li data-start="1886" data-end="1947"><p data-start="1888" data-end="1947">Co-designing a 3D model and placing it on your coffee table</p></li><li data-start="1948" data-end="2008"><p data-start="1950" data-end="2008">Giving live visual instructions over someone’s camera feed</p></li><li data-start="2009" data-end="2098"><p data-start="2011" data-end="2098">Walking through a virtual tour of a product as if you’re both standing in the same room</p></li></ul><p data-start="2100" data-end="2161">It sounds futuristic. But in 2025? It’s getting oddly normal.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq8hca431fp" data-start="2168" data-end="2222">2. Why AR Works Better Than Video for Certain Tasks</h2><p data-start="2224" data-end="2291">Video calls are fine for talking. Sometimes even for brainstorming.</p><p data-start="2293" data-end="2566">But the second you need to physically point to something, move around, or <em data-start="2367" data-end="2371">do</em> something more spatial than verbal—video starts to fall apart. You’re stuck saying things like, “No, the <em data-start="2477" data-end="2484">other</em> corner. No, <em data-start="2497" data-end="2504">below</em> that one,” and hoping the other person magically understands.</p><p data-start="2568" data-end="2605">AR helps with this in three big ways:</p><ol data-start="2607" data-end="3066"><li data-start="2607" data-end="2755"><p data-start="2610" data-end="2755"><strong data-start="2610" data-end="2629">Spatial context</strong><br data-start="2629" data-end="2632">You can place 3D models or annotations <em data-start="2674" data-end="2680">into</em> a real-world space, so everyone sees what you mean—visually and spatially.</p></li><li data-start="2757" data-end="2943"><p data-start="2760" data-end="2943"><strong data-start="2760" data-end="2782">Real-time guidance</strong><br data-start="2782" data-end="2785">Whether it's technical support or design critique, AR lets one person guide another using arrows, highlights, or even hand gestures overlaid on live video.</p></li><li data-start="2945" data-end="3066"><p data-start="2948" data-end="3066"><strong data-start="2948" data-end="2975">Fewer misunderstandings</strong><br data-start="2975" data-end="2978">The clarity that comes with “seeing” versus “describing” cuts down on back-and-forth.</p></li></ol><p data-start="3068" data-end="3203">Honestly, there are moments where it feels like AR adds a shared sixth sense to remote teamwork. It’s not perfect, but it’s impressive.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq8hca431fq" data-start="3210" data-end="3266">3. Who’s Actually Using AR for Collaboration in 2025?</h2><p data-start="3268" data-end="3412">Let’s go industry by industry. The applications are surprisingly broad—some very polished, others still kind of clunky—but the momentum is real.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1iq8hca431fr" data-start="3414" data-end="3446">a. <strong data-start="3421" data-end="3446">Architecture &amp; Design</strong></h3><p data-start="3447" data-end="3709">Designers working in AR can now walk clients through a 3D mockup of a building while standing in an empty lot. They can tweak angles, colors, or even move walls around in real time. Apps like The Wild and Arkio are becoming standard tools for architecture firms.</p><blockquote data-start="3711" data-end="3841"><p data-start="3713" data-end="3841">“It’s like inviting someone into a model home that doesn’t exist yet,” one architect told us. “Clients get it <em data-start="3823" data-end="3827">so</em> much faster.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="mcetoc_1iq8hca431fs" data-start="3843" data-end="3881">b. <strong data-start="3850" data-end="3881">Field Service &amp; Maintenance</strong></h3><p data-start="3882" data-end="4108">Technicians in oil, gas, or manufacturing environments can get remote help from experts without flying them in. A senior engineer can “see” what a junior tech sees through smart glasses and guide them with live AR annotations.</p><p data-start="4110" data-end="4327">RealWear and Microsoft HoloLens 2 continue to dominate this space. And more companies are experimenting with Apple Vision Pro integration, especially since the 2025 SDK updates improved hand tracking and battery life.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1iq8hca431ft" data-start="4329" data-end="4362">c. <strong data-start="4336" data-end="4362">Healthcare and Surgery</strong></h3><p data-start="4363" data-end="4582">Yes, it’s happening here too. AR is being used for remote surgical training, diagnostics, and even assisted procedures. A surgeon in New York can virtually guide a team in Nairobi with 3D overlays on live patient scans.</p><p data-start="4584" data-end="4708">No, it’s not replacing hands-on training, but it’s speeding up education and expanding access where it's desperately needed.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1iq8hca431fu" data-start="4710" data-end="4756">d. <strong data-start="4717" data-end="4756">Manufacturing &amp; Product Development</strong></h3><p data-start="4757" data-end="4936">3D prototyping has gone remote. Teams working on physical products can now review early-stage models in AR, adjust features together, and even test ergonomics (roughly, at least).</p><p data-start="4938" data-end="5079">This has cut iteration cycles dramatically—especially for startups that can’t afford to ship physical prototypes around the world five times.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1iq8hca431fv" data-start="5081" data-end="5109">e. <strong data-start="5088" data-end="5109">Marketing &amp; Sales</strong></h3><p data-start="5110" data-end="5255">Showrooms? Optional. Many companies now use AR experiences to let customers “try” products in their space—everything from furniture to cosmetics.</p><p data-start="5257" data-end="5412">But on the B2B side, teams are using AR to collaborate on pitch decks, demo tools, and visual walkthroughs that feel far more immersive than screen shares.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq8hca431g0" data-start="5419" data-end="5475">4.
