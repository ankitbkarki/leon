The so-called “Apple Car.” We’ve been hearing whispers about it for nearly a decade now-an Apple-designed electric vehicle that would do to the auto industry what the iPhone did to mobile. And yet, here we are, well into 2025, still squinting through rumor fog trying to figure out what’s real and what’s… let’s say, optimistic.</p><p data-start="669" data-end="863">That said, there <em data-start="686" data-end="692">have</em> been some pretty compelling developments lately-some credible leaks, some strange patent filings, and at least a handful of very Apple-like moves in the automotive space.</p><p data-start="865" data-end="1070">So what do we actually know about the Apple Car in 2025? Here’s everything we’ve pieced together so far-technical specs (as much as we can guess), pricing rumors, design clues, release timelines, and more.</p><p data-start="1072" data-end="1090">Let’s get into it.</p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90m12t1d">Is the Apple Car Even Real Anymore?</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90m12t1e">A Brief (and Bumpy) Timeline of the Apple Car So Far</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90m12t1f">Design: What Might the Apple Car Look Like?</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90m12t1g">Apple Car Specs (Rumored, of Course)</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90m12t1h">Software: Where Apple May Actually Win</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90m12t1i">Release Date: Not 2024… but When?</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90m12t1j">Pricing Rumors: Will It Be Insanely Expensive?</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90m12t1k">Will It Be Worth the Wait?</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90m12t1l">Final Thoughts</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90m12t1d" data-start="1097" data-end="1135">Is the Apple Car Even Real Anymore?</h2><p data-start="1137" data-end="1185">This is probably the most honest place to start.</p><p data-start="1187" data-end="1608">For a while, it felt like the Apple Car was drifting into vaporware territory. The project-internally known as <strong data-start="1298" data-end="1315">Project Titan</strong>-has been <em data-start="1325" data-end="1346">on again, off again</em> since around 2014. Some years, Apple reportedly hired hundreds of automotive engineers. Other years, they laid most of them off. At one point, it was unclear whether they even wanted to build a car anymore, or just some software that others could use in theirs.</p><p data-start="1610" data-end="2020">But more recently-late 2023 and early 2024-there’s been movement again. And not just small stuff. In January, Bloomberg reported that Apple had dramatically refocused its car initiative toward launching a <strong data-start="1815" data-end="1846">Level 2+ semi-autonomous EV</strong>-think Tesla-style autonomy, not full robotaxi stuff. This pivot reportedly pushed the release date back to <strong data-start="1954" data-end="1962">2028</strong>, but in the process, made the project far more realistic.</p><p data-start="2022" data-end="2061">Still, “realistic” doesn’t mean “soon.”</p><p data-start="2063" data-end="2226">So no, we probably won’t see the Apple Car in dealerships (or Apple Stores?) this year. But 2024 is shaping up to be the year where details finally start to stick.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90m12t1e" data-start="2233" data-end="2288">A Brief (and Bumpy) Timeline of the Apple Car So Far</h2><p data-start="2290" data-end="2364">Just to put things in perspective, here’s a quick look at how we got here:</p><ul data-start="2366" data-end="3111"><li data-start="2366" data-end="2480"><p data-start="2368" data-end="2480"><strong data-start="2368" data-end="2376">2014</strong> – Project Titan begins in secret.

Apple reportedly shifts focus from building a whole car to just making self-driving software.</p></li><li data-start="2636" data-end="2744"><p data-start="2638" data-end="2744"><strong data-start="2638" data-end="2646">2020</strong> – Hints resurface. A few supply chain leaks and autonomous testing permits spark new speculation.</p></li><li data-start="2745" data-end="2851"><p data-start="2747" data-end="2851"><strong data-start="2747" data-end="2755">2021</strong> – Rumors of a “fully autonomous” Apple Car surface. Target date of 2025 starts floating around.</p></li><li data-start="2852" data-end="2959"><p data-start="2854" data-end="2959"><strong data-start="2854" data-end="2862">2023</strong> – Apple scales back ambitions.

Tim Cook says in an interview that “transportation is an area of deep interest,” without confirming or denying the project.</p></li></ul><p data-start="3113" data-end="3296">That’s a lot of starting, stopping, and recalibrating. But that’s also, honestly, how Apple works with big new categories. The iPhone was in R&amp;D for years. The Vision Pro? Same story.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90m12t1f" data-start="3303" data-end="3351">Design: What Might the Apple Car <em data-start="3339" data-end="3345">Look</em> Like?</h2><p data-start="3353" data-end="3668">Okay, now for the fun part-the aesthetic. Because let’s be real, if Apple is making a car, it’s going to be beautiful. Or at the very least, it’ll have a distinct, borderline minimalist look. Probably something that makes traditional car manufacturers roll their eyes while secretly sketching it in their notebooks.</p><p data-start="3670" data-end="3689">So far, we’ve seen:</p><ul data-start="3691" data-end="3996"><li data-start="3691" data-end="3786"><p data-start="3693" data-end="3786"><strong data-start="3693" data-end="3711">Patent filings</strong> for seamless glass roofs, sensor integration, and odd wheel configurations</p></li><li data-start="3787" data-end="3895"><p data-start="3789" data-end="3895">Concept renders (none official, of course) that resemble everything from a sleek pod to a futuristic sedan</p></li><li data-start="3896" data-end="3996"><p data-start="3898" data-end="3996">A few hints that Jony Ive-former Apple design chief-may have had <em data-start="3963" data-end="3969">some</em> involvement before he left</p></li></ul><p data-start="3998" data-end="4264">The latest believable mockups tend to point toward a <strong data-start="4051" data-end="4072">compact luxury EV</strong>, sort of like a cross between a Tesla Model 3 and a Lucid Air. Smooth curves, no visible seams, few to no physical buttons. Maybe even no steering wheel, although… probably too soon for that.</p><p data-start="4266" data-end="4420">That said, don’t be surprised if the final version looks nothing like the renders floating around. Apple’s good at hiding the real thing until it’s ready.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90m12t1g" data-start="4427" data-end="4466">Apple Car Specs (Rumored, of Course)</h2><p data-start="4468" data-end="4622">Alright, let’s talk internals. Most of this is, admittedly, speculation-but it’s educated speculation based on industry trends and Apple’s own tendencies.</p><p data-start="4624" data-end="4690">Here’s what’s likely or at least <em data-start="4657" data-end="4668">plausible</em> in terms of hardware:</p><div class="_tableContainer_16hzy_1"><div class="_tableWrapper_16hzy_14 group flex w-fit flex-col-reverse" tabindex="-1"><table class="w-fit min-w-(--thread-content-width)" data-start="4692" data-end="5563"><thead data-start="4692" data-end="4779"><tr data-start="4692" data-end="4779"><th data-start="4692" data-end="4717" data-col-size="sm">Feature</th><th data-start="4717" data-end="4779" data-col-size="md">Rumored Details</th></tr></thead><tbody data-start="4868" data-end="5563"><tr data-start="4868" data-end="4954"><td data-start="4868" data-end="4892" data-col-size="sm">Powertrain</td><td data-start="4892" data-end="4954" data-col-size="md">Dual electric motors (AWD), possibly from Hyundai/Kia</td></tr><tr data-start="4955" data-end="5041"><td data-start="4955" data-end="4979" data-col-size="sm">Range</td><td data-start="4979" data-end="5041" data-col-size="md">~300–400 miles per charge</td></tr><tr data-start="5042" data-end="5128"><td data-start="5042" data-end="5066" data-col-size="sm">Battery</td><td data-start="5066" data-end="5128" data-col-size="md">Custom Apple battery tech?

There were also quiet talks with Nissan, but they reportedly fell apart over branding disagreements.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90m12t1h" data-start="5861" data-end="5902">Software: Where Apple May Actually Win</h2><p data-start="5904" data-end="6125">If there’s one area where Apple could seriously leap ahead of the competition, it’s software. Tesla has had a massive head start, but Apple is arguably even more obsessive when it comes to integration and user experience.</p><p data-start="6127" data-end="6149">Expect something like:</p><ul data-start="6151" data-end="6459"><li data-start="6151" data-end="6242"><p data-start="6153" data-end="6242"><strong data-start="6153" data-end="6179">Siri voice integration</strong> that actually works for navigation, climate control, and calls</p></li><li data-start="6243" data-end="6305"><p data-start="6245" data-end="6305">Seamless sync with your <strong data-start="6269" data-end="6305">iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods</strong></p></li><li data-start="6306" data-end="6382"><p data-start="6308" data-end="6382">Real-time traffic and hazard alerts powered by <strong data-start="6355" data-end="6369">Apple Maps</strong> and maybe AI</p></li><li data-start="6383" data-end="6459"><p data-start="6385" data-end="6459">Over-the-air software updates and possibly <strong data-start="6428" data-end="6459">subscription-based features</strong></p></li></ul><p data-start="6461" data-end="6756">It’s not hard to imagine a world where the Apple Car becomes the centerpiece of a larger “Apple lifestyle”-one where your car knows your calendar, unlocks as you approach with your Watch, adjusts the temperature based on your habits, and even pre-selects your favorite podcast as you leave work.</p><p data-start="6758" data-end="6904">Of course, some of that sounds… a little creepy too. But we’ve all handed over a lot of data for convenience before. This won’t be the first time.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90m12t1i" data-start="6911" data-end="6947">Release Date: Not 2024… but When?</h2><p data-start="6949" data-end="7101">Here’s the tough truth. Most reliable sources now peg the Apple Car’s launch around <strong data-start="7033" data-end="7041">2028</strong>, give or take a year. That’s not exactly around the corner.</p><p data-start="7103" data-end="7339">Earlier rumors pointed to 2025, then 2026, but Apple reportedly realized just how hard building a car actually is. Especially when you’re trying to do it the Apple way-where hardware, software, and services all work together flawlessly.</p><p data-start="7341" data-end="7537">There’s a slim chance we’ll get an early reveal or teaser sometime in <strong data-start="7411" data-end="7424">late 2025</strong>, maybe at a keynote or special event. But actual production models? Showroom availability? That’s a longer wait.</p><p data-start="7539" data-end="7695">That said, Apple has a history of under-promising until it’s ready. So who knows-maybe we wake up one day in 2026 and Tim Cook’s holding a car key on stage.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90m12t1j" data-start="7702" data-end="7751">Pricing Rumors: Will It Be Insanely Expensive?</h2><p data-start="7753" data-end="7781">Short answer: yes. Probably.</p><p data-start="7783" data-end="7991">Based on early leaks and Apple’s general positioning in every other product category, the Apple Car isn’t going to be cheap. Most estimates suggest a starting price somewhere between <strong data-start="7966" data-end="7990">$75,000 and $100,000</strong>.</p><p data-start="7993" data-end="8040">That would place it in direct competition with:</p><ul data-start="8042" data-end="8132"><li data-start="8042" data-end="8079"><p data-start="8044" data-end="8079">Tesla Model S or upper-tier Model 3</p></li><li data-start="8080" data-end="8107"><p data-start="8082" data-end="8107">Lucid Air Pure or Touring</p></li><li data-start="8108" data-end="8132"><p data-start="8110" data-end="8132">Mercedes EQE or BMW i5</p></li></ul><p data-start="8134" data-end="8182">But pricing could fluctuate wildly depending on:</p><ul data-start="8184" data-end="8372"><li data-start="8184" data-end="8254"><p data-start="8186" data-end="8254">Battery tech (Apple's been working on something new here, allegedly)</p></li><li data-start="8255" data-end="8283"><p data-start="8257" data-end="8283">Manufacturing partnerships</p></li><li data-start="8284" data-end="8372"><p data-start="8286" data-end="8372">Whether Apple wants to offer different trim levels (Standard vs. Pro vs. Max, anyone?)</p></li></ul><p data-start="8374" data-end="8599">Also-just speculation-but Apple could easily bake in monthly services. Maybe Apple One+ includes car diagnostics, autonomous updates, cloud nav data, etc. And yes, that would be a little annoying. But it’s also... very Apple.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90m12t1k" data-start="8606" data-end="8635">Will It Be Worth the Wait?</h2><p data-start="8637" data-end="8669">Here’s the real question, right?</p><p data-start="8671" data-end="8828">After a decade of rumors, will Apple’s car actually live up to the hype? Or will it become another “Apple TV” moment-nice, expensive, but not transformative?</p><p data-start="8830" data-end="9049">It’s tough to say. The EV market has exploded. Tesla isn’t the only game in town anymore. You’ve got Ford, Rivian, Hyundai, Polestar-all pushing hard and fast. Apple’s entry will have to be more than sleek to stand out.</p><p data-start="9051" data-end="9185">Still, if anyone can rethink how cars <em data-start="9089" data-end="9095">feel</em>-how they interact with us, how they integrate into our digital lives-it’s probably Apple.</p><p data-start="9187" data-end="9230">Just… maybe don’t sell your Tesla just yet.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90m12t1l" data-start="9237" data-end="9254">Final Thoughts</h2><p data-start="9256" data-end="9302">The Apple Car is coming. Probably. Eventually.</p><p data-start="9304" data-end="9480">2024 hasn’t delivered the vehicle itself, but it has brought us closer-more credible rumors, more focused leaks, and a clearer picture of what Apple’s actually trying to build.</p><p data-start="9482" data-end="9619">No flying cars. No steering wheel-less pods (yet). But maybe something smarter, cleaner, and more seamless than what’s on the road today.</p><p data-start="9621" data-end="9804">If nothing else, it’s fun to watch.
