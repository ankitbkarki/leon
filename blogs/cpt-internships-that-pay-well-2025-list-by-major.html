Beyond being just a resume booster, a CPT internship allows you to build essential skills, gain valuable industry exposure, and secure better job prospects after graduation. More than that, it can also lay the groundwork for longer-term work authorization in the U.S., which is essential for international students planning to stay and build their careers here.</p><p data-start="828" data-end="1251">However, it's important to understand that not all CPT internships are created equal. While some internships may offer minimal pay, others can offer substantial wages, with opportunities for growth and full-time job offers post-graduation. The key to making the most of your CPT experience lies in understanding how to identify high-paying opportunities and the factors that can make a difference in your internship search.</p><p data-start="1253" data-end="1535">In this article, we’ll guide you through the importance of CPT internships in 2025, with a focus on which majors tend to secure higher wages, what you can do to improve your chances of landing a well-paying role, and how to leverage your CPT internship for long-term career success.</p><h2 data-start="1542" data-end="1585"><strong data-start="1545" data-end="1585">Understanding CPT: A Quick Refresher</strong></h2><p data-start="1587" data-end="1929">Before we delve into the specifics of CPT internships, it’s important to first understand what CPT is and how it works. Curricular Practical Training is a type of temporary work authorization for F-1 students, allowing them to gain hands-on experience through internships, co-ops, or practicum that directly relate to their academic program.</p><p data-start="1931" data-end="1980">There are a few key points to remember about CPT:</p><ul data-start="1981" data-end="2242"><li data-start="1981" data-end="2035"><p data-start="1983" data-end="2035">CPT must be directly related to your field of study.</p></li><li data-start="2036" data-end="2123"><p data-start="2038" data-end="2123">It must be approved and documented by your school’s Designated School Official (DSO).</p></li><li data-start="2124" data-end="2242"><p data-start="2126" data-end="2242">It can either be part-time (up to 20 hours per week) during the semester or full-time during official school breaks.</p></li></ul><p data-start="2244" data-end="2542">In some cases, students may have access to Day 1 CPT, meaning they can begin working as soon as they start their academic program. While this is legal under certain conditions, it comes with additional scrutiny, so it is vital to consult with your DSO and immigration attorney to ensure compliance.</p><h2 data-start="2549" data-end="2597"><strong data-start="2552" data-end="2597">How Much Do CPT Interns Get Paid in 2025?</strong></h2><p data-start="2599" data-end="3013">The pay for CPT interns can vary widely based on several factors including your major, the location of the internship, the company you’re interning with, your level of experience, and the type of work you’re doing. For example, a technical role in a high-demand field like Computer Science or Data Science is likely to offer much higher pay compared to internships in non-technical fields like Business or Finance.</p><p data-start="3015" data-end="3075">Here’s a breakdown of average hourly wages by major in 2025:</p><ul data-start="3077" data-end="3290"><li data-start="3077" data-end="3113"><p data-start="3079" data-end="3113"><strong data-start="3079" data-end="3099">Computer Science</strong>: $30–$50/hour</p></li><li data-start="3114" data-end="3146"><p data-start="3116" data-end="3146"><strong data-start="3116" data-end="3132">Data Science</strong>: $35–$55/hour</p></li><li data-start="3147" data-end="3174"><p data-start="3149" data-end="3174"><strong data-start="3149" data-end="3160">Finance</strong>: $20–$38/hour</p></li><li data-start="3175" data-end="3213"><p data-start="3177" data-end="3213"><strong data-start="3177" data-end="3199">Business Analytics</strong>: $25–$40/hour</p></li><li data-start="3214" data-end="3245"><p data-start="3216" data-end="3245"><strong data-start="3216" data-end="3231">Engineering</strong>: $22–$45/hour</p></li><li data-start="3246" data-end="3290"><p data-start="3248" data-end="3290"><strong data-start="3248" data-end="3276">Healthcare/Public Health</strong>: $18–$35/hour</p></li></ul><p data-start="3292" data-end="3647">It's important to recognize that these figures are averages and can fluctuate based on the specific circumstances of the internship, such as the company’s size, industry, and geographic location. For instance, an internship at a tech giant in San Francisco could offer $50 per hour, whereas a similar role in a smaller city might offer significantly less.</p><h2 data-start="3654" data-end="3724"><strong data-start="3657" data-end="3724">Major-by-Major Breakdown of High-Paying CPT Internships in 2025</strong></h2><h3 data-start="3726" data-end="3781"><strong data-start="3730" data-end="3781">1.
