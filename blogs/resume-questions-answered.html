If you're trying to write the "perfect" resume in 2025, you’ve probably been bombarded with conflicting advice. Some say you should only use one page. Others insist on listing every certification you’ve ever even thought about getting. And then there's that advice from five years ago telling you to “tailor it for every job,” which sounds good… until you're doing it for the 11th time in a week.</p><p data-start="657" data-end="801">So what <em data-start="665" data-end="675">actually</em> matters now? What are recruiters and hiring managers really looking for in a resume this year—not in theory, but in practice?</p><p data-start="803" data-end="893">Let’s take a walk through it. No fluff, just the stuff that seems to be working right now.</p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmg">First, Understand What You're Up Against</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmh">The Format Still Matters (But Maybe Not in the Way You Think)</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmi">One Page vs. Two: The Debate That Never Dies</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmj">The Top Third Is Prime Real Estate</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmk">Keywords: Annoying but Necessary</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90r7jrml">The Bullet Point Formula (That’s Not Really a Formula)</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmm">Soft Skills: Show, Don’t List</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmn">Education and Certifications: Keep It Clean</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmo">What About AI Tools?

You're competing not just with people, but with algorithms. AI screening tools, applicant tracking systems (ATS), and increasingly impatient recruiters who are skimming hundreds of resumes in a single day.</p><p data-start="1281" data-end="1347">That sounds kind of bleak, I know. But it’s also oddly clarifying.</p><p data-start="1349" data-end="1575">If you know your resume might only get scanned for 6 seconds by a real human—or 0.6 seconds by a robot—you start thinking differently. You stop trying to write the most <em data-start="1518" data-end="1528">creative</em> resume and start writing the most <em data-start="1563" data-end="1570">clear</em> one.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmh" data-start="1582" data-end="1646">The Format Still Matters (But Maybe Not in the Way You Think)</h2><p data-start="1648" data-end="1958">Alright, formatting. Let’s not overthink it. In 2025, the best format is still the most readable one. Clean, uncluttered, and no weird fonts. You can get a little creative with section headers or subtle color, but unless you're applying for a job in design or marketing, that creativity should have boundaries.</p><p data-start="1960" data-end="2000">A few simple rules that haven’t changed:</p><ul data-start="2001" data-end="2284"><li data-start="2001" data-end="2105"><p data-start="2003" data-end="2105"><strong data-start="2003" data-end="2039">Use reverse chronological order.</strong> Always. Recruiters want to see your most recent experience first.</p></li><li data-start="2106" data-end="2178"><p data-start="2108" data-end="2178"><strong data-start="2108" data-end="2132">Stick to one column.</strong> Multi-column layouts are still risky for ATS.</p></li><li data-start="2179" data-end="2284"><p data-start="2181" data-end="2284"><strong data-start="2181" data-end="2199">PDF over Word.</strong> Unless the job posting says otherwise, PDF is the safer bet—it preserves formatting.</p></li></ul><p data-start="2286" data-end="2463">Oh, and those infographic-style resumes with pie charts measuring how “proficient” you are in Microsoft Excel? Please. We’re past that. No one knows what “80% Excel” even means.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmi" data-start="2470" data-end="2517">One Page vs. Two: The Debate That Never Dies</h2><p data-start="2519" data-end="2602">Here’s the thing—this argument is still going because there <em data-start="2579" data-end="2583">is</em> no universal rule.</p><p data-start="2604" data-end="2826">If you’re early in your career, yes, one page is generally enough. But if you’ve been working for 8, 10, 15 years? Cramming everything onto a single page can start to look more like you're hiding things than being concise.</p><p data-start="2828" data-end="3040">Two pages are totally fine—<em data-start="2855" data-end="2859">if</em> you have the experience to back it up. Just don’t fill the second page with fluff. Once it starts looking like you’re stretching to hit a word count, it might be time to pull back.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmj" data-start="3047" data-end="3084">The Top Third Is Prime Real Estate</h2><p data-start="3086" data-end="3317">Here’s something people often overlook: the first 3-4 inches of your resume are everything. That’s the part that shows up in preview mode on a recruiter's screen. It’s the part they see before they decide to scroll (or not scroll).</p><p data-start="3319" data-end="3338">So what goes there?</p><ul data-start="3340" data-end="3828"><li data-start="3340" data-end="3470"><p data-start="3342" data-end="3470"><strong data-start="3342" data-end="3368">Name and contact info.</strong> Don’t get cute here. Full name, email, phone, LinkedIn. Maybe your location or city if it’s relevant.</p></li><li data-start="3471" data-end="3613"><p data-start="3473" data-end="3613"><strong data-start="3473" data-end="3495">Headline or title.</strong> This isn’t mandatory, but it helps. Something like “Product Manager | SaaS | 7+ YOE” tells them who you are, quickly.</p></li><li data-start="3614" data-end="3825"><p data-start="3616" data-end="3825"><strong data-start="3616" data-end="3645">Summary (if you use one).</strong> A short, punchy 2-3 line snapshot. Not a generic paragraph about how you’re “motivated” and “detail-oriented”—but something that actually says what you do and where you're headed.</p></li></ul><p data-start="3829" data-end="4072">Some people skip the summary entirely, and honestly, that’s fine too. If your experience speaks for itself, no need to over-explain. But if you’re pivoting careers or re-entering the workforce, a well-written summary can help connect the dots.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmk" data-start="4079" data-end="4114">Keywords: Annoying but Necessary</h2><p data-start="4116" data-end="4354">Here's the reality: many companies still use ATS to filter resumes, and those systems are... let’s just say, not especially nuanced. If your resume doesn’t contain the right keywords, it might get filtered out before a human even sees it.</p><p data-start="4356" data-end="4462">That doesn’t mean you should "stuff" your resume full of jargon. But it does mean you should be strategic.</p><p data-start="4464" data-end="4714">A quick trick? Take the job posting you’re applying to, and drop it into a word cloud generator. Look at which words pop out. If you're qualified for the job, chances are you can naturally weave those terms into your resume without it feeling forced.</p><p data-start="4716" data-end="4956">Also, match the terminology. If the posting says “project management,” and your resume says “program coordination,” you might want to adjust. Same skill, but different language—and unfortunately, ATS isn’t great at making those connections.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrml" data-start="4963" data-end="5020">The Bullet Point Formula (That’s Not Really a Formula)</h2><p data-start="5022" data-end="5179">Let’s talk bullets. The heart of your resume. This is where people get overwhelmed—trying to make every line sound epic, or falling into vague nonsense like:</p><blockquote data-start="5181" data-end="5222"><p data-start="5183" data-end="5222">Responsible for managing team projects.</p></blockquote><p data-start="5224" data-end="5270">Okay, but... what did that actually look like?</p><p data-start="5272" data-end="5387">A more human, useful way to think about bullet points is this: each one should show action, impact, or improvement.</p><p data-start="5389" data-end="5472">Not every line has to hit all three. That’s not realistic. But you want to aim for:</p><ul data-start="5473" data-end="5526"><li data-start="5473" data-end="5487"><p data-start="5475" data-end="5487">What you did</p></li><li data-start="5488" data-end="5504"><p data-start="5490" data-end="5504">How you did it</p></li><li data-start="5505" data-end="5526"><p data-start="5507" data-end="5526">What came out of it</p></li></ul><p data-start="5528" data-end="5563">Here’s a basic (but solid) example:</p><blockquote data-start="5564" data-end="5694"><p data-start="5566" data-end="5694">Led a cross-functional team of 6 in developing a new customer onboarding process, reducing onboarding time by 30% over 3 months.</p></blockquote><p data-start="5696" data-end="5716">Now compare that to:</p><blockquote data-start="5717" data-end="5758"><p data-start="5719" data-end="5758">Worked with team to improve onboarding.</p></blockquote><p data-start="5760" data-end="5779">See the difference?</p><p data-start="5781" data-end="5964">Also, don’t be afraid to mix up the structure a little. Some bullets can lead with a result, others with an action. If everything follows the same pattern, it starts to sound robotic.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmm" data-start="5971" data-end="6003">Soft Skills: Show, Don’t List</h2><p data-start="6005" data-end="6184">Everyone claims to be a "team player" or a "strong communicator." But in 2025, just listing soft skills in a separate section is kind of... meaningless. It doesn’t prove anything.</p><p data-start="6186" data-end="6264">Instead, you want to embed those qualities into your experiences. For example:</p><blockquote data-start="6266" data-end="6395"><p data-start="6268" data-end="6395">Facilitated weekly cross-team meetings to align engineering and product teams, reducing miscommunication-related delays by 40%.</p></blockquote><p data-start="6397" data-end="6473">That says a lot about your communication skills—without ever using the word.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmn" data-start="6480" data-end="6526">Education and Certifications: Keep It Clean</h2><p data-start="6528" data-end="6630">Unless you’re a recent grad, your education section shouldn’t be the star of the show. Keep it simple:</p><ul data-start="6631" data-end="6814"><li data-start="6631" data-end="6639"><p data-start="6633" data-end="6639">Degree</p></li><li data-start="6640" data-end="6653"><p data-start="6642" data-end="6653">Institution</p></li><li data-start="6654" data-end="6740"><p data-start="6656" data-end="6740">Graduation year (optional if you're nervous about age bias—yeah, it’s still a thing)</p></li><li data-start="6741" data-end="6814"><p data-start="6743" data-end="6814">Any relevant honors or coursework, but only if it's genuinely relevant.</p></li></ul><p data-start="6816" data-end="6941">Certifications matter more in some industries than others. In tech, they can boost your profile. In marketing? Maybe less so.</p><p data-start="6943" data-end="7072">That said, don’t clutter the section with expired or irrelevant ones. A CPR certification isn’t helping you get a job in finance.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmo" data-start="7079" data-end="7123">What About AI Tools? Should You Use Them?</h2><p data-start="7125" data-end="7319">Here’s the controversial part. Yes, AI resume builders are everywhere now. ChatGPT, resume-specific tools, even browser extensions that scan job listings and spit out tailored resumes on demand.</p><p data-start="7321" data-end="7334">Do they help?</p><p data-start="7336" data-end="7558">Sometimes. They’re great for brainstorming bullet points or overcoming writer’s block. But don’t rely on them to do the whole thing. Most AI-generated resumes still sound like... well, AI. Generic, flat, a little soulless.</p><p data-start="7560" data-end="7753">The sweet spot? Use them for structure or draft ideas—but revise heavily. Add your voice. Tweak the phrasing. Make it sound like a human wrote it. Because, in the end, one still has to read it.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmp" data-start="7760" data-end="7801">Personalization: Worth the Extra Time?</h2><p data-start="7803" data-end="7967">Yes, tailoring your resume for every job is ideal. But if you’re applying to 30 roles this week, that’s just not sustainable. (Honestly, who has that kind of time?)</p><p data-start="7969" data-end="7987">Instead, try this:</p><ul data-start="7989" data-end="8283"><li data-start="7989" data-end="8044"><p data-start="7991" data-end="8044">Create a "base resume" with all your core experience.</p></li><li data-start="8045" data-end="8173"><p data-start="8047" data-end="8173">Have a few interchangeable summary sections and headlines depending on the job type (e.g., data-focused vs. strategy-focused).</p></li><li data-start="8174" data-end="8283"><p data-start="8176" data-end="8283">Customize the top third for each role. That way, the part that gets the most attention still feels aligned.</p></li></ul><p data-start="8285" data-end="8385">That little bit of tailoring—especially in the top third—often makes more difference than you think.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmq" data-start="8392" data-end="8423">What Recruiters Actually Say</h2><p data-start="8425" data-end="8610">This part isn’t scientific, but after speaking with a handful of recruiters (some from tech, some from more traditional industries), here’s a short list of things they wish people knew:</p><ul data-start="8612" data-end="8902"><li data-start="8612" data-end="8656"><p data-start="8614" data-end="8656">Yes, they read cover letters… <em data-start="8644" data-end="8656">sometimes.</em></p></li><li data-start="8657" data-end="8711"><p data-start="8659" data-end="8711">Typos still matter. Proofread, then proofread again.</p></li><li data-start="8712" data-end="8773"><p data-start="8714" data-end="8773">They <em data-start="8719" data-end="8723">do</em> check LinkedIn. Make sure it matches your resume.</p></li><li data-start="8774" data-end="8828"><p data-start="8776" data-end="8828">Gaps are okay—just address them briefly and move on.</p></li><li data-start="8829" data-end="8902"><p data-start="8831" data-end="8902">Listing your GPA? Only if it’s stellar and you’re early in your career.</p></li></ul><p data-start="8904" data-end="9080">One even said, “I spend more time on resumes that read like the person actually <em data-start="8984" data-end="8992">wanted</em> to be understood.” That stuck with me. A little clarity and authenticity go a long way.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iq90r7jrmr" data-start="9087" data-end="9131">Final Thoughts (That Aren’t Really Final)</h2><p data-start="9133" data-end="9409">Here’s the messy truth: there’s no such thing as a “perfect” resume. Not really. Because different recruiters value different things. One might love brevity; another wants depth. Some scan for keywords like a machine (or literally are one), while others still read every line.</p><p data-start="9411" data-end="9484">So the goal isn’t perfection. It’s clarity, alignment, and believability.</p><p data-start="9486" data-end="9678">Can someone glance at your resume and quickly understand what you’re good at? Can they see why you applied for <em data-start="9597" data-end="9603">that</em> job, not just <em data-start="9618" data-end="9623">any</em> job? And does it sound like an actual person wrote it?</p><p data-start="9680" data-end="9744">If you can say yes to those things—you’re already ahead of most.</p></div><footer><p class="content__last-updated"><time datetime="2025-05-02T12:54">This article was updated on May 2, 2025</time></p><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__next"><a class="content__nav__link" href="https://leonstaff.com/blogs/cpt-internships-that-pay-well-2025-list-by-major.html" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">CPT Internships That Pay Well in 2025</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><nav><ul class="footer__nav"><li class="footer__nav-item"><a href="https://leonstaff.com" target="_self">HOME</a></li><li class="footer__nav-item"><a href="https://leonstaff.com/#services" target="_self">SERVICES</a></li><li class="footer__nav-item"><a href="https://leonstaff.com/#about" target="_self">ABOUT</a></li><li class="footer__nav-item"><a href="https://leonstaff.com/#contact" target="_self">CONTACT</a></li><li class="footer__nav-item"><a href="https://leonstaff.com/#faq" target="_self">F&amp;Q</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Leon Consulting Corporation</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
